# SecureShare - Persistent Storage Implementation

**Last Updated:** June 8, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Production Ready ✅

## Overview

SecureShare includes a complete persistent storage system that replaces previous in-memory storage. Files and metadata are saved to the local filesystem with full encryption, allowing data to persist across server restarts while maintaining zero-knowledge security.

## Storage Architecture

### File Structure
```
data/
├── index.json          # Quick lookup index for file metadata
└── files/
    ├── file-id-1.json  # Individual file data with encrypted content
    ├── file-id-2.json
    └── ...
```

### Data Flow
1. **Upload**: File encrypted → Saved to `data/files/` → Index updated
2. **Retrieval**: Check index → Load from `data/files/` → Return data
3. **Deletion**: Remove from `data/files/` → Update index

## Features

### ✅ File Persistence
- Files saved as JSON in individual files
- Metadata indexed for fast lookups
- Atomic operations for data consistency

### ✅ Security
- Encrypted content stored separately from metadata
- No plaintext content ever written to disk
- File metadata excludes sensitive encryption data when not needed

### ✅ Performance
- Index file for O(1) metadata lookups
- Lazy loading of encrypted content
- Efficient file size tracking

### ✅ Maintenance
- Automatic cleanup of old files
- Storage statistics and monitoring
- Configurable retention policies

## API Endpoints

### Storage Management
- `GET /api/dashboard/files` - List user files
- `DELETE /api/dashboard/files?id=<fileId>` - Delete a file
- `GET /api/admin/storage` - Get storage statistics
- `POST /api/admin/storage` - Run maintenance tasks

### File Operations
- `POST /api/upload` - Upload and encrypt file
- `GET /api/file/[id]` - Get file metadata
- `POST /api/file/[id]` - Get encrypted content (with password)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Storage settings
STORAGE_DIR=./data
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760  # 10MB
CLEANUP_DAYS=30

# Security settings
ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM=AES-GCM
KEY_DERIVATION_ITERATIONS=100000
```

### File Size Limits
- Default: 10MB per file
- Configurable via `MAX_FILE_SIZE` environment variable
- Validation happens before encryption

### Cleanup Policy
- Default: Files older than 30 days are eligible for cleanup
- Manual cleanup via admin API
- Automatic cleanup can be scheduled (future enhancement)

## Production Considerations

### File Storage
- Current implementation uses local filesystem
- For production, consider:
  - Network-attached storage (NAS)
  - Cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
  - Database storage for smaller files

### Scalability
- Current implementation suitable for single-server deployments
- For horizontal scaling, implement:
  - Shared storage backend
  - Database-backed metadata
  - Distributed file storage

### Backup Strategy
- Backup the entire `data/` directory
- Index file contains all metadata for recovery
- Individual file JSONs contain complete encrypted data

### Security Hardening
- Restrict filesystem permissions on `data/` directory
- Consider encryption at rest for the storage directory
- Implement rate limiting for upload/download operations
- Add audit logging for file access

## Migration from In-Memory Storage

The new persistent storage is a drop-in replacement for the previous in-memory Map. Existing API endpoints continue to work unchanged.

### Breaking Changes
- None - API remains compatible

### New Features
- Files persist across server restarts
- Storage statistics and monitoring
- Automatic cleanup capabilities
- Better error handling and logging

## Future Enhancements

### Database Integration
- PostgreSQL/MySQL for metadata
- Redis for caching frequently accessed files
- Full-text search capabilities

### Cloud Storage
- AWS S3 integration
- Google Cloud Storage support
- CDN distribution for faster downloads

### Advanced Features
- File versioning
- Compression for large files
- Thumbnail generation for images
- Virus scanning integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Storage directory not writable**
```bash
chmod 755 data/
chmod 644 data/*
```

**Index file corruption**
- Delete `data/index.json`
- Restart server (will rebuild index from individual files)

**Disk space issues**
- Run cleanup: `POST /api/admin/storage` with `{"action": "cleanup"}`
- Check storage stats: `GET /api/admin/storage`

### Monitoring
- Check `data/index.json` for file count
- Monitor disk usage of `data/` directory
- Review server logs for storage errors
