## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Authentication Flow
```
User Registration ‚Üí Default 'user' role ‚Üí JWT with role claim ‚Üí Role-based access control
```

### File Operations
```
File Upload ‚Üí User Association ‚Üí Ownership Verification ‚Üí Secure Operations
```

### Contact System
```
Form Submission ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Success Response
```

## üìÅ File Structure Changes

### New Interfaces
- `ContactMessage` - Contact form data structure
- Enhanced `User` interface with role field
- Enhanced `JWTPayload` with role claim

### New Classes
- `ContactStorage` - Contact message persistence
- Enhanced `FileStorage` with ownership verification

### Enhanced Routes
- All folder operations now require authentication
- File deletion requires ownership verification
- Admin routes require admin role
- Contact form saves messages to storage

## üöÄ Production Readiness

### Security ‚úÖ
- Role-based access control implemented
- File ownership verification in place
- Comprehensive input validation
- CSRF and rate limiting protection

### Data Integrity ‚úÖ
- Persistent storage for all operations
- Proper error handling and logging
- Data validation at all entry points
- Atomic operations for critical data

### User Experience ‚úÖ
- Consistent toast notification system
- Clear error messages and feedback
- Interactive data visualization
- Responsive design maintained

### Monitoring ‚úÖ
- Comprehensive logging for all operations
- Storage statistics and analytics
- Contact message tracking
- User activity monitoring

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Email Integration** - Send emails for contact form submissions
2. **Advanced Analytics** - More detailed charts and metrics
3. **File Versioning** - Track file revision history
4. **Backup System** - Automated data backup procedures
5. **Monitoring Dashboard** - Real-time system health monitoring

### Scalability Considerations
1. **Database Migration** - Move from file-based to database storage
2. **Cloud Storage** - Integrate with AWS S3 or similar
3. **Caching Layer** - Add Redis for frequently accessed data
4. **Load Balancing** - Prepare for horizontal scaling
